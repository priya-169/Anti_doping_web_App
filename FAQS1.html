                    <p>TUEs are granted for a specific method or a substance with a defined dosage and route of
                        administration. They are also granted for a specific period of time and do expire. The athlete
                        must comply with all the treatment conditions outlined in the TUE application. Material changes
                        to the treatment require a new application and TUEC review. <br><br>
                        Once a TUE has been granted by an ADO, it will inform WADA, which then has the opportunity
                        to review the decision. If the decision does not conform to the ISTUE, WADA may reverse it and
                        deny the TUE.
